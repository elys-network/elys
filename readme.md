## Localnet Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to spin up a new localnet using the Elys network for development purposes. Follow these steps to set up your localnet environment.

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have `git`, `make`, Go environment, and `jq` installed on your machine.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Elys Repository**

   First, clone the Elys repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elys-network/elys.git
   ```

2. **Build the Binary**

   Navigate into the cloned repository and build the binary using:

   ```bash
   git tag -f v999.999.999 && make install
   ```

   This command will install the `elysd` daemon.

3. **Download the Latest TestNet Snapshot**

   To get the latest TestNet snapshot available for the Elys network, use the following command to download the latest TestNet snapshot that uses the changes from the `main` branch:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.elys && curl -o - -L https://snapshots.elys.network/elys-snapshot-main.tar.lz4 | lz4 -c -d - | tar -x -C ~/
   ```

4. **Spin Up the Localnet**

   Use the command below to start the localnet:

   ```bash
   elysd start
   ```

## Installation

### With Makefile (Recommended)

This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to build the Elys Chain binary from the source code using the provided makefile. The makefile automates the build process and generates a binary executable that can be run on your local machine.

1. Clone the Elys chain repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elys-network/elys.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd elys
```

3. Optionally, checkout the specific branch or tag you want to build:

```bash
git checkout [version]
```

4. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. For instance, on Ubuntu you need to install the `make` tool:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --yes make
```

   To generate proto files install `buf` and `clang-format`, then:
```bash
make proto
```

5. **Optional**: Use _RocksDB_ instead of _pebbledb_

Ensure that you have RocksDB installed on your machine. On Ubuntu, you can install RocksDB using the following suite of commands:

```bash
# set rocks db version
ROCKSDB_VERSION=8.9.1

# install rocks db dependencies
sudo apt install -y libgflags-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev

# download and extract on /tmp
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/archive/refs/tags/v${ROCKSDB_VERSION}.tar.gz
tar -xvf v${ROCKSDB_VERSION}.tar.gz && cd rocksdb-${ROCKSDB_VERSION} || return

# build rocks db
export CXXFLAGS='-Wno-error=deprecated-copy -Wno-error=pessimizing-move -Wno-error=class-memaccess'
make shared_lib

# install rocks db
sudo make install-shared INSTALL_PATH=/usr

# cleanup to save space
rm -rf /tmp/rocksdb-${ROCKSDB_VERSION} /tmp/v${ROCKSDB_VERSION}.tar.gz
```

In order to build the binary with RocksDB, you need to run the following command:

```bash
ROCKSDB=1 make build
```

Note: RocksDB is only required for Linux machines. For macOS, you can continue without installing RocksDB.

When running `ROCKSDB=1 make build`, if you are getting this error:

```bash
elysd: error while loading shared libraries: librocksdb.so.8.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

You might need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to the local library path. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
```

6. Run the `make build` command to build the binary:

```bash
make build
```

7. The binary will be generated in the `./build` directory. You can run the binary using the following command:

```bash
./build/elysd
```

You can also use the `make install` command to install the binary in the `bin` directory of your `GOPATH`.

### With Ignite (Experimental)

To install the latest version of Elys binary, execute the following command on your machine:

```
curl https://get.ignite.com/elys-network/elys@latest! | sudo bash
```

## Development

You can use `ignite-cli` to get you started with your development environment. To install `ignite-cli`, execute the following command on your machine:

```
curl https://get.ignite.com/ignite/ignite-cli@latest! | sudo bash
```

### Initialize

To initialize and serve your development environment, execute the following command:

```
ignite chain serve -r
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts Elys in development. The `-r` flag rebuilds the binary before starting the chain.

## Validator Guide

The validator guide is accessible [here](./validator.md).

## Network Launch

The network guide is accessible [here](./network.md).

## Architecture

The architecture guide is accessible [here](./architecture.md).

## Release

To release a new version of Elys, create and push a new tag with `v` prefix. A new draft release with the configured targets will be created.

```
git tag v0.1
git push origin v0.1
```

After a draft release is created, make your final changes from the release page and publish it.
