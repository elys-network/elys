# Ignite CLI

**Ignite CLI** is the all-in-one platform to build, launch, and maintain any crypto application on a sovereign and secured blockchain. It is a developer-friendly interface to the Cosmos SDK, the world's most widely-used blockchain application framework. Ignite CLI generates boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing business logic. Latest version 0.27.1 targets Cosmos SDK v47.3 and 0.26.1 targets Cosmos SDK v0.46.x.

## Troubleshooting
- Ignite uses placeholder to scaffold codes automatically. Once it gets broken, Ignite CLI won't work. So please be careful of those placeholders if you want to keep using Ignite CLI.
- Placeholder inserted in import section might get removed automatically after executing Ignite CLI scaffold function. Each placeholder has its tag like #1, #2, #3 etc. If you see placeholder #2 but don't see placeholder #1, it means it was removed by fault - developer or Ignite CLI itself. We should recover the missing placeholder to make Ignite CLI work again.
