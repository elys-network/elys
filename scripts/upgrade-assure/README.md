# Troubleshooting

These are some problems and its solutions when the script is executed

- The O.S could kill the process if you donÂ´t have enough ram this happened in 6.6.24-1-MANJARO (64 bits) with 16gb of ram a solution was create a swapFile
```
https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Swap#Using_a_Swapfile
```
-  Timeout, if you have timeout problems with the node or waiting for the next block you can use these flags: 
timeout-wait-for-node is expressed in seconds
timeout-next-block is expressed in minutes

```
--timeout-wait-for-node=600
--timeout-next-block=15
```
