# Funding Calculation and Payment

The funding rate is a critical mechanism in the perpetual contracts system designed to incentivize traders to take positions that counterbalance the market trend. This helps to maintain a balanced market, encouraging traders to engage in positions where the liabilities of long and short traders are not too heavily skewed in one direction.

## 1. **Overview of Funding Rate Calculation**

The funding rate is computed at each block using the total long and short liabilities, which form what is known as the **Open Interest (OI)**.

- **Long traders pay short traders** if the long liabilities exceed short liabilities.
- **Short traders pay long traders** if the short liabilities exceed long liabilities.

This system is designed to **incentivize traders to take on risk against the prevailing market trend**. For example, if the majority of traders are long, the funding rate will encourage some traders to open short positions by requiring long traders to pay a funding fee to short traders.

### 2. **Key Parameter Governing the Funding Rate**

The funding rate is influenced by several module governance parameters:

- **Fixed Funding Fee Rate (`fixed_funding_fee_rate`)**:  
  The base rate used to calculate the funding rate.  
  Example value: `"0.300000000000000"`

### 3. **Funding Rate Formula**

The funding rate is calculated as follows:

- **When Long Liabilities Exceed Short Liabilities:**

  ```
  funding_rate = fixed_rate * (long_custody - short_liability) / (long_custody + short_liability)
  ```

- **When Short Liabilities Exceed Long Liabilities:**
  ```
 funding_rate = fixed_rate * (short_liability - long_custody) / (long_custody + short_liability)
  ```

This formula ensures that the funding rate stays within defined boundaries, incentivizing traders to take positions in opposition to the prevailing market trend, thereby promoting liquidity and market balance.

### 4. **Funding Fee Collection**

At every block, the calculated funding fees are collected and sent to the **Funding Fee Collection Address**. The details of this process can be found in the source code:  
[Funding Fee Collection Code](https://github.com/elys-network/elys/blob/main/x/perpetual/keeper/handle_funding_fee_collection.go).

The collected funding fees act as the source for redistribution to the traders, depending on the market's funding rate outcome.

### 5. **Funding Fee Distribution**

The distribution of funding fees is based on the calculated funding rate and serves to reward traders who are taking positions opposite the market trend.

- **Funding Rate Direction**:  
  The funding rate determines **which side of the market receives the collected funding payments**.
  - **Positive funding rate**: Short traders receive payments.
  - **Negative funding rate**: Long traders receive payments.

However, the **actual distribution amount** is not directly proportional to the funding rate alone. Instead, the amount that each position receives is calculated based on the size of that position relative to the total liabilities on the side that is receiving the funding payments.

The formula for determining the amount distributed to each position is as follows:

```
payment_to_position = (position_liabilities / pool_liabilities) * total_funding_collected
```

Where:

- **`position_liabilities`**: The liabilities (position size) of the individual trader receiving the funding payment.
- **`pool_liabilities`**: The total liabilities on the side of the market receiving the funding payment (long or short, depending on the funding rate direction).
- **`total_funding_collected`**: The total amount of funding fees collected during the block.

#### Example:

- If a trader holds 10% of the total liabilities on the receiving side, they will receive 10% of the total collected funding fees.
