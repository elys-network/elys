# Concepts

The `commitment` module in the Elys Network allows users to commit tokens, which are then subject to various operations such as vesting, uncommitting, and staking. This module provides mechanisms for managing token lockups, vesting schedules, and interactions with the staking system. It enhances the network's flexibility in managing user assets, rewards, and staking parameters.
