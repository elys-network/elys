# Concepts

The `leveragelp` module in the Elys Network facilitates leveraged liquidity provision in AMM pools. It allows users to open and manage leveraged positions using collateral, enhancing their potential returns from liquidity provisioning. The module manages parameters such as leverage limits, pool thresholds, and positions, and includes mechanisms for liquidation and health checks to ensure the safety and stability of the leveraged positions.
