The `oracle` module in the Elys Network provides decentralized price feeds and asset information. It facilitates querying and setting asset prices from different sources such as Band and Elys, maintaining the integrity and availability of price data within the network. This module enhances the efficiency and reliability of price-related operations across the network.
