# Concepts

The `tokenomics` module in the Elys Network manages the economic aspects of the network, including airdrops, inflation parameters, and dynamic updates to these parameters. This module ensures the smooth operation of the networkâ€™s incentive mechanisms and the sustainable distribution of rewards to network participants.

### Airdrops

Airdrops are distributions of tokens to a specific group of users, often based on predefined criteria. The `tokenomics` module allows for the creation, update, and deletion of airdrop entries, ensuring targeted and efficient token distribution.

### Inflation

Inflation refers to the systematic increase in the total supply of tokens over time. The module supports both genesis inflation, set at network launch, and time-based inflation, which can be adjusted over different periods.
