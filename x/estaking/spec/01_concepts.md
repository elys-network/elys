# Concepts

The `estaking` module in the Elys Network extends basic staking capabilities, providing additional functionalities such as managing and distributing rewards from multiple validators, updating staking parameters, and handling Eden and EdenB token mechanics in relation to staking rewards. This module aims to enhance the staking experience and efficiency within the network.
