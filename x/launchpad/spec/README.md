# Launchpad module spec

We are planning to run a public launch of the ELYS token on our own DEX for our community who has been eager to get involved since we recently launched the testnet of our web/mobile app.

We want to do it in a very decentralized manner without any KYC/AML documentation necessary.

The structure that we are looking to execute is something along the following lines ( nothing set in stone).

The initial premise of a public launch for elys.

1. intial reservation price is 0.75 USDC
2. total number of ELYS tokens to be reserved = 5 million
3. total raise is 3.75 million USDC
4. the launch pad will continue for a week or if it's filled fully.
   4 a) Users can bring in USDC, ETH, ATOM tokens to reserve ELYS ( based on a set swap rate).
5. people who reserve their ELYS will also get additional bonus tokens based on the slot in which they reserve their elys ( the slot is determined by the % of the raise)
6. 0-20% raise 100% bonus, 20-30% raise 90% bonus, 30-40% raise bonus 80%, 40-50% raise bonus 70%, 50-60% raise bonus 60%, 60-70% raise bonus 50%, 70% -80% raise bonus 40%, 80-100% raise bonus 30%,
7. the reserved tokens will be liquid right away at mvp.
8. the bonus tokens will be locked for 6 months and then get vested over 12 months linearly.
9. upto 50% of initial investment that is reserved can be withdrawn in the same currency that was used to reserve for upto 6 months. The amount that is withdrawn will be returned to the account and the elys will be sent back to the Elys foundation.
10. hence the guys who reserve have the option to withdraw upto 50% of their inital inevstment, and at the same time can get max of 100% bonus ( if invested early on)
11. if an investor decides to withdraw their investment then their bonus will be cut by the same amount as the withdraw.

For example. Let's say investor buys 1000 Elys and has received a 80% bonus of 800 Elys.

If the user decides to withdraw 30% or 300 Elys then their bonus will also be cut by 30% or 30% \* 800 = 240 Elys.

The investor will be left with 700 Elys as investment and 560 Elys as bonus.

## Comments

- Use fee grant since users can't get ELYS token at the beginning
- For point 6 when people are getting bonus. If someone reserve elys with 50% bonus and then tomorrow if he comes and reavers elys and the bonus is still 50% then these two positions have to be combined

Each reservation should be consolidated per bonus per currency used
